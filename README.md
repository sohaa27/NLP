# NLP Learning Projects

This repository contains beginner to intermediate Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects
created as part of my learning journey. The goal of this repository is to understand core NLP
concepts through hands-on practice using Python.

These projects focus on text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and
lexicon-based NLP techniques.
